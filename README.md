# minerals-classification-through-Deep-learning-models
Developed a real-time deep learning model to classify mineral types using image data. Preprocessed and visualized mineral samples, implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch, and achieved high accuracy across seven mineral classes including biotite, bornite, chrysocolla, malachite, muscovite, pyrite, and quartz.
